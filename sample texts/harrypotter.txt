Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. But their lives changed forever on a dull, gray Tuesday when a large, wild-looking man appeared at their doorstep.

"Hagrid," said Harry, staring up at the giant of a man. "What’re you doing here?"

"Harry Potter," rumbled Hagrid, his voice deep and gruff, like rocks tumbling down a hill. "Yer a wizard, Harry. I’ve come ter take yeh to Hogwarts."

Harry blinked, his green eyes wide behind his glasses. "A wizard? Me? But I’m just… Harry."

"Jest Harry, eh?" Hagrid chuckled, a sound like a small earthquake. "Yeh’ve got no idea what’s comin’, lad. Yer famous in our world—famous fer somethin’ yeh don’t even remember!"

Before Harry could ask more, a stern voice cut through the air. "Rubeus Hagrid, what do you think you’re doing, barging into a Muggle home like this?"

It was Professor McGonagall, her tone sharp and precise, her lips pressed into a thin line. She wore emerald-green robes and a pointed hat, and her eyes glinted with authority.

"Minerva!" Hagrid boomed, scratching his tangled beard. "Dumbledore sent me. It’s time fer Harry ter know the truth."

"The truth?" Harry asked, his voice curious but uncertain. "What truth?"

Professor McGonagall sighed, adjusting her spectacles. "Mr. Potter, you are not merely a boy. You are a wizard, destined for greatness—or trouble, if Hagrid’s influence is anything to go by."

"Oi!" Hagrid protested, though his grin showed he wasn’t truly offended. "I’m a fine influence, I am!"

Harry looked between them, his mind racing. This was the start of something extraordinary—he could feel it.
